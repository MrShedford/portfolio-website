                <p>Worked with Dr. John Keating on a pedagogical tool for linguistic students. Developed the backend in Node
                    & MongoDB, using Angular 1 for the frontend. Developed my full stack engineering, research & organisational
                    skills. <br> This exposure to research allowed me how to work alone effectively, seeing as I was the
                    sole developer on the project. This really helped me curb procrastination levels and stay productive
                    when working solo.
